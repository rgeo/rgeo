The shapefiles in this directory are a test suite used by shapelib.
They don't cover every case, but seemed a good starting point.
Shapelib can be found at http://shapelib.maptools.org/

The numbered test files are generated by the shptest tool. The
non-numbered case (including a dbf file) is generated by the
makeshape.sh script. Both were run from shapelib release 1.3.0b2.

Since we're embedding the test cases themselves here in this
directory, we note that they are Copyright 1999 Frank Warmerdam,
