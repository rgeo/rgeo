    # == SFS 1.1 Description
    #
    # Geometry is the root class of the hierarchy. Geometry is an abstract
    # (non-instantiable) class.
    #
    # The instantiable subclasses of Geometry defined in this International
    # Standard are restricted to 0, 1 and 2-dimensional geometric objects
    # that exist in 2-dimensional coordinate space (R2).
    #
    # All instantiable Geometry classes described in this part of ISO 19125
    # are defined so that valid instances of a Geometry class are
    # topologically closed, i.e. all defined geometries include their
    # boundary.
    #
    # == Notes
    #
    # Geometry is defined as a module and is provided primarily for the
    # sake of documentation. Implementations need not necessarily include
    # this module itself. Therefore, you should not depend on the result
    # of <tt>is_a?(Geometry)</tt> to check type. Instead, use the
    # provided check_type class method (or === operator) defined in the
    # Type module.
    #
    # Some implementations may support higher dimensional objects or
    # coordinate systems, despite the limits of the SFS.
    #
    # == Forms of equivalence
    #
    # The Geometry model defines three forms of equivalence.
    #
    # * <b>Spatial equivalence</b> is the weakest form of equivalence,
    #   indicating that the objects represent the same region of space,
    #   but may be different representations of that region. For example,
    #   POINT(0 0) and a MULTIPOINT(0 0) are spatially equivalent, as are
    #   LINESTRING(0 0, 10 10) and
    #   GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(0 0), LINESTRING(0 0, 10 10, 0 0)).
    #   As a general rule, objects must have factories that are
    #   Factory#eql? in order to be spatially equivalent.
    #
    # * <b>Representational equivalence</b> is a stronger form, indicating
    #   that the objects have the same representation, but may be
    #   different objects. All representationally equivalent objects are
    #   spatially equivalent, but not all spatially equivalent objects are
    #   representationally equivalent. For example, none of the examples
    #   in the spatial equivalence section above are representationally
    #   equivalent. However, two separate objects that both represent
    #   POINT(1 2) are representationally equivalent as well as spatially
    #   equivalent.
    #
    # * <b>Objective equivalence</b> is the strongest form, indicating
    #   that the references refer to the same object. Of course, all
    #   pairs of references with the same objective identity are also
    #   both representationally and spatially equivalent.
    #
    # Different methods test for different types of equivalence:
    #
    # * <tt>equals?</tt> and <tt>==</tt> test for spatial equivalence.
    # * <tt>rep_equals?</tt> and <tt>eql?</tt> test for representational
    #   equivalence.
    # * <tt>equal?</tt> tests for objective equivalence.
    #
    # All ruby objects must provide a suitable test for objective
    # equivalence. Normally, this is simply provided by the Ruby Object
    # base class. Geometry implementations should normally also provide
    # tests for representational and spatial equivalence, if possible.
    # The <tt>==</tt> operator and the <tt>eql?</tt> method are standard
    # Ruby methods that are often expected to be usable for every object.
    # Therefore, if an implementation cannot provide a suitable test for
    # their equivalence types, they must degrade to use a stronger form
    # of equivalence.
