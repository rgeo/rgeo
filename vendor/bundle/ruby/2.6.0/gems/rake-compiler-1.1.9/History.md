        rake-compiler cross-ruby HOST=i386-mingw32 (OSX mingw32 port)

### 0.7.0 / 2009-12-08

* Enhancements
  * Allow generation of JRuby extensions. Thanks to Alex Coles (myabc) for the
    contribution.
    This will allow, with proper JDK tools, cross compilation of JRuby gems
    from MRI.

    ```ruby
      Rake::JavaExtensionTask.new('my_java_extension', GEM_SPEC) do |ext|
        # most of ExtensionTask options can be used
        # plus, java_compiling:
        ext.java_compiling do |gem_spec|
          gem_spec.post_install_message = "This is a native JRuby gem!"
        end
      end
    ```

    Please note that cross-compiling JRuby gems requires either JRUBY_HOME or
    JRUBY_PARENT_CLASSPATH environment variables being properly set.

  * Allow alteration of the Gem Specification when cross compiling. Closes [#3](https://github.com/rake-compiler/rake-compiler/issues/3)
    This is useful to indicate a custom requirement message, like DLLs
    installation or similar.

    ```ruby
    Rake::ExtensionTask.new('my_extension', GEM_SPEC) do |ext|
      ext.cross_compile = true
      # ...
      ext.cross_compiling do |gem_spec|
        gem_spec.post_install_message = "You've installed a binary version of this gem"
      end
    end
    ```

* Bugfixes
  * Detect GNU make independently of distribution based naming.
    Thanks to flori for patches.
  * Usage of #dup to duplicate gemspec instead of YAML dumping.
  * No longer support Ruby older than 1.8.6
  * No longer support RubyGems older than 1.3.5
  * Force definition of binary directory and executables. Closes [#11](https://github.com/rake-compiler/rake-compiler/issues/11)
  * Workaround path with spaces issues using relative paths. Closes [#6](https://github.com/rake-compiler/rake-compiler/issues/6)
  * Removed gemspec, GitHub gems no more

* Known issues
  * Usage of rake-compiler under projects with Jeweler requires some tweaks
    Please read issue 73) for Jeweler:
    http://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler/issues/73

    For a workaround, look here:
    http://gist.github.com/251663

### 0.6.0 / 2009-07-25

* Enhancements
  * Implemented 'fat-binaries' generation for cross compiling
    (for now). Thanks to Aaron Patterson for the suggestion and
    original idea.

        rake cross native gem RUBY_CC_VERSION=1.8.6:1.9.1

    Will package extensions for 1.8 and 1.9 versions of Ruby.
  * Can now cross compile extensions for 1.9 using 1.8.x as base.
    Be warned: works from 1.8 to 1.9, but not if your default ruby is 1.9

        rake cross compile RUBY_CC_VERSION=1.9.1

  * Allow simultaneous versions of Ruby to compile extensions.
    This change allow 1.8.x compiles co-exist with 1.9.x ones
    and don't override each other.

    Please perform <tt>rake clobber</tt> prior compiling again.
  * Allow optional source file URL for cross-compile tasks.
    (Thanks to deepj for the patches)

        rake-compiler cross-ruby VERSION=1.9.1-p0 SOURCE=http://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.9/ruby-1.9.1-p0.tar.bz2

* Bugfixes
  * Removed strict versioning for gems since it clash with fat binaries.
    From now on, if your gem only targets a specific version of Ruby, please
    indicate it in the Gem::Specification (<tt>required_ruby_version</tt>)

### 0.5.0 / 2009-04-25

* Enhancements
  * Allow generation of multiple gems for Windows (EXPERIMENTAL)
    This allows build gems for both VC6 and MinGW builts of Ruby
    (Thanks to Jonathan Stott for the suggestion)

    ```ruby
    Rake::ExtensionTask.new('my_extension', GEM_SPEC) do |ext|
      ext.cross_compile = true
      ext.cross_platform = ['i386-mswin32', 'i386-mingw32']
    end
    ```

### 0.4.1 / 2009-04-09

* Enhancements
  * Target specific versions of Ruby when generating binaries.
    This avoids installing a 1.8.x binary gem in 1.9.x and viceversa.
    (Thanks to Aaron Patterson for the patches)

* Bugfixes
  * No longer raises error if rake-compiler configuration is missing.
    Not all users of a project would have it installed.
    (Thanks to Aaron Patterson for the patch)

### 0.4.0 / 2009-04-03

* Enhancements
  * Bended the convention for extension folder.
    Defining <tt>ext_dir</tt> for custom extension location.

    ```ruby
    Rake::ExtensionTask.new('my_extension') do |ext|
      ext.ext_dir = 'custom/location'         # look into custom/location
    end                                       # instead of ext/my_extension
    ```

  * Better detection of mingw target across Linux/OSX.
    Exposed it as Rake::ExtensionCompiler
  * Display list of available tasks when calling rake-compiler script
  * Track Ruby full versioning (x.y.z).
    This will help the compilation of extensions targetting 1.8.6/7 and 1.9.1

* Bugfixes
  * Better output of Rake development tasks (Thanks to Luis Parravicini).
  * Proper usage of Gem::Platform for native gems (Thanks to Dirkjan Bussink).
  * Don't use autoload for YAML (present problems with Ruby 1.9.1).

### 0.3.1 / 2009-01-09

* Enhancements
  * Download cross-ruby source code using HTTP instead of FTP.
  * Disabled Tcl/Tk extension building on cross-ruby (helps with 1.9).

* Bugfixes
  * Workaround bug introduced by lack of Gem::Specification cloning. Fixes DM LH #757.

    of default one.

        rake cross compile RUBY_CC_VERSION=1.8

* Enhancements
  * Properly update rake-compiler configuration when new version is installed.
  * Automated release process to RubyForge, yay!

* Bugfixes
  * Corrected documentation to reflect the available options

### 0.2.1 / 2008-11-30

* New features

  * Allow cross compilation (cross compile) using mingw32 on Linux or OSX.
  * Allow packaging of gems for Windows on Linux or OSX.

* Enhancements

  * Made generation of extensions safe and target folders per-platform

* Bugfixes
